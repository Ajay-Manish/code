Given a graph and a source vertex in the graph, find the shortest paths from the source to all vertices in the given graph
the user needs to enter the node distances which is made global and is a two dimensional matrix.
user needs to  enter the number of nodes
then a for loop is used which will  consider the routing table of one node which is named as a vector.
there is a array called vivsted which will make all the nodes visited 1 else 0.
then the minimum value function is called which will detect least value in the array
update_vector  will update the vector with the new minimum value
this process is repeated for all the nodes.
